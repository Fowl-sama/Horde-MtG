# MTG Horde Player

This tool is a helper for playing Horde, which is a cooperative format for Magic: The Gathering, where one or more players can play against a "dumb" deck.

The rules that I'm currently basing it on, as well as the only deck currently supported, can be found in [this forum post](http://www.mtgsalvation.com/forums/the-game/commander-edh/variant-commander/490641-zombie-horde-200-card-list)
